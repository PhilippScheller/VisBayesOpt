**MboPlotEstimationUncertainty**

**Description**    
 The plot visualizes the degree of uncertainty in the estimation of new points. 


**Interpretation**   
  * Left plot: Absolute difference between estimated $\hat y$ and evaluated (true) point $y$ over the Iterations  
  * Right plot: Frequency of differences between $\hat y$ and $y$  

  
**How to use**  
  * Quantify estimation uncertainty: if the overall frequency of deviations is high, the estimation error large for higher iterations then the surrogate does not well and should be changed.  
  
  
**Modifications**
  * We can select the $highlight\_iter$ to calculate the plots for exactly this iteration
