**MboPlotProgress**

**Description**    
 The plot shows the minimum value of the objective function $f(x)$ after $n$ iterations leading to a monotone decreasing function.


**Interpretation**   
  * If the function shows a decrease the optimization improves.  
  * If the function stays (more or less) constant the optimizer runs into convergence.  

**How to use**  
  * If the plot still shows major (no) decreases at larger $n$ one may adjust the constraints of the optimization to grant a larger (lower) number of maximum iterations (to save cost).
